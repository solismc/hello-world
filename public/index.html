          <h2>How the love affair began</h2>
          <p>
        I did my first triathlon in Fort DeSoto in the fall of 2008. 
        It was an exhilarating experience and knew right after I finished that I was hooked.
        It was what they call a sprint distance. Roughly 300 yd swim, 10-mile Bike and 5K Run. 
        I had some much fun both doing the race as well as the training to prepare for it. 
        It wasnâ€™t all fun and games, I will admit. 
        Sometimes getting out for a run in 80-degree heat with 90% humidity was not a lot of fun.
