        <h2>How the love affair began</h2>
        <p>
            Since I was in college, I had been curious about photography. A few years ago, I decided to take it seriously and bought
            my first DSLR camera. I debated between taking some classes at a local school or just read and learn on my own.
            I went online, bought a couple of books and began my journey. I have nejoyed it alot. I like that when I travel
            for races, I can bring my camera and make some great memories to keep.
