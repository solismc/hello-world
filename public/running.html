    <h2>How the love affair began</h2>
    <p>
      I did my first triathlon in Fort DeSoto in the fall of 2008. It was an exhilarating experience and knew right after I finished
      that I was hooked. It was what they call a sprint distance. Roughly 300 yd swim, 10-mile Bike and 5K Run. I had so
      much fun both doing the race as well as the training to prepare for it. It wasnâ€™t all fun and games, I will admit.
      Sometimes getting out for a run in 80-degree heat with 90% humidity was not a lot of fun.
